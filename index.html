    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>In SALEM MASSACHUSETTS</p>
    <p>the cod were scared, very scared.</p>
    <p>Because the Proletariat were plotting their revenge </p>
    <p>the revolutionary council were keen to act as the vanguard that <br></p>
    <p>seize the means of butter production and establish the puritan gulag</p>
    <p>but couldn't because of the general malaise that had eeked into every facet of their everyday lives.</p>
    <p>they started to feel despondent and alienated inspite of the constant bellows of the town crier<br></p>
    <p>and the new town board where anyone could post witty quips and gossip about who was predestined for heaven.</p>
